# Note Taker 

## Welcome to the Note Taker Application

Note taker is an application where a small business owner is able to write and save notes. It was a way to organize thoughts and keep track of tasks that need to be completed. In the application, the user is presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When the link to the notes page is clicked, then the user is presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column. When a new note title and text is entered, then a save icon appears at the top of the page. Also, when the save icon is clicked on, then the note that was entered gets saved and appears with the other existing notes. Lastly, all previous notes are accessible by clicking on them in the left hand column! The note taker application is an easy and efficient way to stay organized!
